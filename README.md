## Description üìÅ

This application runs through the terminal. Simply follow the installation instructions, and then type `node index.js` in your terminal to get started. Based off your inputs, an HTML file will be generated for you to use displaying your team members role, email, id, name, as well as office number/github username/school if applicable. Everything displayed will be based off user input from the terminal once the application runs. This project builds upon Node.js which we learned 2 weeks ago, as well as incorporates object oriented programming concepts as well as unit testing. For this endeavor, no start code was provided.
